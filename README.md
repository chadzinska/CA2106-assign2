## CA2106 assignment 2, deisgn a website prototype

**Requirements**
- Picking a theme, e.g. a personal blog, a portfolio for an artist, a company landing
page, an e-commerce website, etc.
- Design a prototype of a website for a client in the selected domain. The prototype should include a set of static webpages that can demonstrate the main features of the website, for example:
• Homepage
• Login
• Sign up
• About
• Contact
• Gallery
• List of news/Blog posts / News content details
• List of products / Product details
• Shopping cart
• Payment
• Booking events/tours
• Etc.

**Submision requirements:**
Submit on Loop:
• A report (pdf/docx)
• Source codes: a zip file that contains a set of HTML webpages along with necessary resources (e.g. js, css, images etc.) to run the webpages properly
• Deploy your web on the DCU server so that it can be accessed on https://student.computing.dcu.ie/[team_representative_user_name]
• Deadline: 11.59 pm - 23/12/2023 (Saturday)


**Code requirements:**
• Include at least 3 features and 10 webpages (i.e. 10 HTML files);
• One feature can be supported by one or more web pages;
• Each webpage needs to be filled with relevant sample content of the feature. For example, if you build a web page that shows a list of books for sale, you may show some sample book products as a grid. Each product includes its name, price etc. When users click on a product, it opens a new page that shows detailed information about that book.
• You may want to add more functions/effects to the page to demonstrate your idea to help improve user experience, e.g. what happens when users put their mouse over a product/article?
• It is possible to use some external libraries (e.g. slideshows, login box etc.) and integrate them into your website. But remember to cite them and describe in the report how you use them.
• Note that the most important task here is to showcase your ability to use front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Jquery/Bootstrap/other relevant libraries) to deliver a good design idea for a website;

**Report requirements:**
• Title
• List of members:
• Name
• Student number
• Email
• Tasks
• Percentage of contribution in the project
• Introduction (1 page):
• Briefly describe the website, e.g. what is the website about? What is the audience? The main features of the website?
• The URL to the website
• Website features
• Describe all features of the website
• Each feature may have the following content:
• Briefly describe what the feature is expected to do on your website;
• A snapshot of the parts of the website that are relevant to the feature, along with some comments if necessary;
• If you need to use external resources (e.g CSS/js libraries) for this feature, describe how you use them to build
the feature

**The group project will be evaluated in terms of:**
- The completeness of the project (i.e. demonstrate at least 3 features and 10 html pages); (30%)
- The diversity and complexity of front-end technologies used in the project (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and other external libraries); (30%)
- The consistency and appropriateness of the design with the selected topic; (20%)
- Coding style (e.g. the code should be easy to read, and comments should be used where necessary); (10%)
- Wow factor, e.g. the creativeness of the design or more innovative features; (10%)
